## Data Review

- [ ] Product/version identity comes from manifests, not SQL Server database names.
- [ ] Data validation warnings were reviewed against `docs/data-validation-warnings.md`.
- [ ] Missing `views.json` or `triggers.json` exports are intentional.
- [ ] Dependency resolution warnings are expected SQL Server metadata artifacts.

- [ ] Public build artifact was reviewed before merge.
- [ ] Changes merged to `main`.
