# Contribution Workflow

Laserfiche Data Dictionary contributions should be reviewed before they are copied into the published static data files.

## Documentation Notes

1. Use local editing mode to draft table notes.
2. Apply the table note template when starting a new table review.
3. Keep the note focused on purpose, safe read-only reporting use, join notes, version caveats, and known columns.
4. Export `notes.json` from the app.
5. Submit the exported notes through a GitHub Issue for review before publishing.

Community submissions are issue-only. Do not open pull requests. Maintainers
review issue attachments or pasted Markdown/JSON, then make any repository
changes themselves.

Proposed documentation notes may be submitted as:

- `notes.json` exported from local editing mode.
- Markdown that identifies product, version, table/object, proposed summary,
  safe reporting use, join notes, version caveats, and known columns.
- A documentation correction issue with the current wording and proposed
  replacement wording.

Review status should move through:

- `Draft`: working notes that have not been checked.
- `In review`: proposed notes ready for another administrator to review.
- `Approved`: reviewed notes that can be copied into the static data folder.
- `Stale`: notes that need another pass because product versions or schema evidence changed.

## Schema Exports

Schema exports must be metadata only. Do not submit table row data, customer names, record values, document metadata values, or database names.

Submitted exports should move through this maintainer review path before they
are imported:

1. `Submitted`: issue opened with product, version, and expected JSON files.
2. `Privacy review`: confirm files contain schema metadata only.
3. `Validated`: import preview has no errors and warnings are understood.
4. `Imported`: static data files are generated locally.
5. `Documentation review`: notes, examples, glossary, and known limitations are reviewed.
6. `Published`: public build and deployed site verification pass.

Expected export files:

- `manifest.json`
- `schemas.json`
- `tables.json`
- `columns.json`
- `primaryAndUniqueKeys.json`
- `foreignKeys.json`
- `indexes.json`
- `views.json`
- `routines.json`
- `triggers.json`
- `dependencies.json`

Some optional result sets may be empty for a product/version. Empty files are acceptable when the export script produced no rows.

## Duplicate Versions

If a submitted product/version already exists, treat it as a replacement request. Review the source, export date, product version, and file completeness before replacing existing static files.

## Export Script Compatibility

Use `docs/sql-server-schema-export.sql` with SQL Server 2016 or newer. The script relies on `FOR JSON` output and SQL Server catalog views. It reads metadata only and does not modify Laserfiche databases.
