# Contribute Schema Exports

Laserfiche Data Dictionary uses SQL Server schema metadata to document product databases for read-only reporting, troubleshooting, and education.

Schema exports must not include table row data, customer data, document metadata values, database names, server names, credentials, or screenshots of production records.

Exports for other Laserfiche product versions are useful.

## Missing Versions Wanted

Exports are especially useful for product versions not listed above. Before exporting, check the current `public/data/<product>/versions.json` file or the public app product/version dropdown to avoid duplicate submissions.

## Export Steps

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio or another SQL client.
2. Connect to the target Laserfiche product database.
3. Open `docs/sql-server-schema-export.sql`.
4. Set:
   - `@ProductKey`: `forms`, `lfds`, `repository`, or `workflow`
   - `@ProductName`: display name, such as `Forms`
   - `@ProductVersion`: exact product version
   - `@DatabaseRole`: product database role, such as `forms`
5. Leave `@IncludeModuleDefinitions = 0` unless definitions are specifically needed for internal review.
6. Run the script.
7. Save each result set as UTF-8 JSON.

Expected file names:

- `manifest.json`
- `schemas.json`
- `tables.json`
- `columns.json`
- `primaryAndUniqueKeys.json`
- `foreignKeys.json`
- `indexes.json`
- `views.json`
- `routines.json`
- `triggers.json`
- `dependencies.json`

Some optional result sets may be empty. Empty `views.json`, `routines.json`, `triggers.json`, or `dependencies.json` can be valid for a product/version.

## Privacy Checks

Before submitting:

- Confirm no table row data is included.
- Confirm the SQL Server database name was not used as the product or version identifier.
- Confirm the files came from the metadata export script, not manual table queries.
- Confirm `dbo.sysdiagrams` is not included. The import process excludes it, but submissions should still avoid SSMS-created diagram objects.
- Confirm the submission passes `docs/privacy-review-checklist.md`.

## Submit

Use the GitHub issue template named `Schema export submission`. Community
submissions are handled through GitHub Issues only; do not open a pull request.

If the product/version already exists, submit it as a replacement request and explain why the existing snapshot should be replaced.
