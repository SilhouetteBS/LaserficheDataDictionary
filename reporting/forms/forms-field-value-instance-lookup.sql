/*
Forms field-value to instance lookup reporting pattern.

Target: reporting database, not the Forms product database.
Product schema evidence: Forms 12.0.2603.30215 AI export.

Usage:
  1. Open in SQL Server Management Studio with SQLCMD Mode enabled.
  2. Set FormsDatabase to the Forms product database name.
  3. Execute from the reporting database where rpt objects should live.

Notes:
  - The view reads Forms product tables only.
  - Do not add indexes, views, stored procedures, or other objects to the Forms product database.
  - Submitted values can include personal or sensitive data. Restrict permissions on reporting objects.
