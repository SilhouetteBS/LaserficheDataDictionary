# Contributing

Thank you for helping review the FicheBait Laserfiche Data Dictionary.

This project accepts community feedback and metadata-only schema exports for
read-only reporting, troubleshooting, and education. Do not submit row data,
customer-specific values, database names, server names, screenshots of records,
credentials, connection strings, or private notes.

## Ways To Contribute

- Submit a metadata-only schema export for a missing product/version.
- Suggest a table, column, relationship, or glossary correction.
- Report UI, diagram, compare, or data-loading bugs.
- Propose safe read-only reporting examples.

Community contributions are handled through GitHub Issues only. Please do not
open pull requests; maintainers will make repository changes after issue review.

## Schema Export Submissions

Follow `docs/contribute-schema-exports.md` and use the `Schema export
submission` issue template.

Expected files:

- `manifest.json`
- `schemas.json`
- `tables.json`
- `columns.json`
- `primaryAndUniqueKeys.json`
- `foreignKeys.json`
- `indexes.json`
- `views.json`
- `routines.json`
- `triggers.json`
- `dependencies.json`

Optional result sets may be empty when the export script produced no rows.

## Privacy Requirements

Before submitting anything, read:

- `docs/data-privacy.md`
- `docs/privacy-review-checklist.md`
- `docs/known-limitations.md`

Submissions that contain row data, environment-specific identifiers, database
names, server names, credentials, or production screenshots will be rejected.

## Documentation Corrections

Use the `Documentation correction` issue template. Include the product, version,
table/object/column, current wording, proposed wording, and non-sensitive source
context.

Documentation notes should focus on:

- purpose
- safe read-only reporting use
- join notes
- version caveats
- known status/type values

## Review Flow

Schema exports and notes should move through:

- `Submitted`
- `Privacy review`
- `Validated`
- `Imported`
- `Documentation review`
- `Published`

Maintainers may edit contributed wording for consistency, safety, and clarity
before publishing.

## Local Validation

For maintainers reviewing a change:

```powershell
npm ci
npm run validate
npm run validate:full
npm run verify:public-build
```

For deployed-site verification:

```powershell
$env:SITE_URL='https://silhouettebs.github.io/LaserficheDataDictionary/'
npm run verify:deployed-site
```

## Support Boundary

This is an unofficial FicheBait community resource. It is not Laserfiche support
documentation. Manually writing to or modifying Laserfiche product databases,
tables, etc. will violate your Laserfiche Support plan and is not supported.
